                                <p>The best strategy depends on your specific goals and who you’re trying to reach with your message. If you talk to us, our solution will be based on both your business and marketing goals. For instance, if you’re just looking to raise awareness of your brand, we’ll measure a different set of metrics than if you’re looking to increase the number of leads. Common tactical options include content marketing, social media, email marketing, paid search advertising (aka “pay per click” or PPC), paid social media advertising, and search engine optimization (SEO). Your solutions could be one or a combination of these, not to mention some traditional media if it makes sense.</p>
